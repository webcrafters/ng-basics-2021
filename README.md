# Reusing components in Angular



## Task 1

Create a component "FunComponent" that displays a title and some paragraphs.

Both the title the paragraphs are input properties of the component.

The title is a string. The pragraphs are a string array.

The component should fill all the available space within its html parent element. If the parent is 200px wide, so is FunComponent. If the parent is 40vh high, so is FunComponent.

The component has a distinct background color, a small padding and no borders.

If the content of FunComponent overflows, vertical scrolling should be possible.
